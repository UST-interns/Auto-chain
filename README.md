Supply chain management system using blockchain(vehicle)
Most of the individuals have vehicles now.Vehicles are a part of life style nowadays.
And also the ratio of manufacturing a car increasing according to the demands of the customer. Let us think about the security of the car? We have lot,Anti-Theft system Jammers...etc .

But think about you are going to a service centre and request a service from them.If the mechanic change your vehicle part and replace with a duplicate one.You cant even imagine that, right? And also there are different identification system for vehicles now a days such as VIN(Vehicle Identification Number),RFID(Radio Frequency ID) etc. This are only for the entire vehicle.It's not related to the Vehicles Parts.So we want a complete secure system log.That ended with a idea of securing vehicle Identification Numbers in Blockchain.

Blockchain is a distributed ledger that provide a immutable log via proof of consensus,hash algorithms.So ot can act as a ledger that record everything based on the Smart Contracts in the Blockchain.And once it is recorded in the Blockchain it can't be changed so it act as a proof for the log files in the ledger.In our Project we are focusing on the security of vehicle and vehicle parts by record it to the Blockchain using Smart contract.
In a car life cycle there are different stakeholders present in the vehicle industry.Manufacturer,Retail Dealer,Car Owner are the main stakeholders apart from that there are second-hand car owner,Logistic agencies,Decommission Agencies, etc .Our project can be extended to any other use cases in the Supply chain System. So Different stakeholders in the chain can be verify this legitimacy of the system using Blockchain.
